          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I’m Geroge Williams, a middle-aged man whose two greatest
            passions—Scientology and improv comedy—have done an excellent job of
            ensuring I die alone. I spend my days trying to unlock my mind’s
            full potential, though at this rate, I’ll probably achieve
            enlightenment right as I flatline. When I’m not auditing my soul for
            past-life traumas, I’m on stage doing improv, where the audience’s
            silence is so deafening it might as well be my eulogy. People say
            you should do what you love, but considering my life choices, I
            think they meant that as a warning, not encouragement. My dating
            life is so barren that even my Thetan has started ghosting me. But
            hey, at least when I inevitably fade into obscurity, I can take
            comfort knowing I’ve spent my time mastering the fine art of making
            people uncomfortable—both spiritually and comedically.

                  A Scientologist is hired to babysit Tom Cruise’s kids but
                  insists on auditing them before bedtime. The toddlers outsmart
                  them by using their “playtime” to ask questions like, “Why
                  does Scientology have so many rules?” and “Can I get an
                  E-meter for my toys?” The babysitter is left in complete
                  confusion while Tom Cruise is off somewhere jumping on

                  A Scientology employee works a literal toll booth on the
                  Bridge to Total Freedom, charging absurd fees for minor
                  spiritual upgrades. (“Oh, you want emotional stability?

                  can only apply for jobs based on past lives. Turns out, their
